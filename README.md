### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced data scientist with a strong background in programming, statistics, and machine learning.
My skills span from extracting and cleaning data to building robust packages and full production quality apps
backed with machine learning models and state-of-the-art data visualizations.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some super fun 'but secret for now' projects..
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about  :tunisia: Tunisia!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: best way is to send me a mail, I check that thing more than I check time..
- âš¡ Fun fact: My (extended) family is the only one in the world with this name, 'rabiibouhestine' is never taken :laughing:
