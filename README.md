### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an R Programmer specialising in R Shiny Development with 8+ years of experience in building data driven software. I have had the opportunity of collaborating with diverse businesses, companies, and agencies worldwide since 2018.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on open source projects like [aNCA](https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA), [pharmapkgs](https://github.com/pharmaR/pharmapkgs) and [riskmetric](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about  :tunisia: Tunisia!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: best way is to send me an email, I check that thing more than I check time..
- âš¡ Fun fact: My (extended) family is the only one in the world with this name, 'rabiibouhestine' is never taken :laughing:
